# wallpapers
This is a aggregation of wallpapers i like. 
These are not mine... 
Moved out of "github:weriomat/nixos-config"
Cant be asked to make this a flake output with automatic lutgen

The shell script is inspired by https://github.com/IogaMaster/prism/blob/main/flake.nix

# Notes
Each time a new wallpaper is added please run `nix run .`
